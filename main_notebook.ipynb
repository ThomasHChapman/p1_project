    "Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.\n",

Further, it will be important to generate engagement with Microsoft's titles both to maximize return on investment and to legitimize Microsoft as a content producer in the future. Therefore, this analysis aims to generate recommendations on how best to deploy the content production budget. \n",

The IMDB database contains robust information for each title--most notably the title, release date and relevant genres. The dataset from TheNumbers.com will primarily be used for return on investment data, including worldwide gross revenue and movie production budget. The Movie Database contains a proprietary popularity score which is calculated based on a number of factors to measure engagement. Documentation for TMDB's popularity score can be found [here.](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/popularity)."
