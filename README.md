# Microsoft Movie Studios Business Plan

## Overview

## Business Problem
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

Movie production has significant up-front costs that will require internal stakeholder support to adequately fund new projects. Further, it will be important to generate engagement with Microsoft's titles both to maximize return on investment and to legitimize Microsoft as a content producer in the future. Therefore, this analysis aims to generate recommendations on how best to deploy the content production budget. 

We will use data from IMDB, The Numbers and The Movie Database to determine answers to the following questions:

- What genres of movie are likely to optimize return on investment?

- What is the relationship between movie budget and expected gross revenue? 

- What season/month should we target releases in order to optimize our return on investment?
